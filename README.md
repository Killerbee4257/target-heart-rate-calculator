# 🫀 Target Heart Rate Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python program that calculates your **maximum heart rate** and **target heart rate zones** for moderate and intense exercise levels — based on your age.

This project was created as part of a college programming assignment. It follows a flowchart and pseudocode to demonstrate input/output, variable processing, and formatted output using `f-strings`.

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their age.
2. The program calculates:
   - **Maximum Heart Rate**: `220 - age`
   - **Moderate Target Zone**: 50% to 70% of max
   - **Intense Target Zone**: 70% to 85% of max
3. The results are displayed clearly using `f-strings`, with numbers rounded to one decimal place.

## 🧪 Sample Output

Enter your age: 20

For Age = 20 years,
Maximum Heart Rate = 200 bpm
Target Heart Rate for moderate activity = 100.0 to 140.0 bpm
Target Heart Rate for intense activity = 140.0 to 170.0 bpm

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to follow and translate pseudocode into a working Python program
- How to use variables, math operations, and formatted output
- The importance of clean code structure and inline comments

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add input validation (e.g. handle non-numeric input)
- Turn into a function-based or class-based program
- Add an option to run multiple times or exit
